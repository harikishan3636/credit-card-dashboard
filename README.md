I utilize a dataset from Kaggle, leveraging MySQL for data cleaning before exporting the refined data to Power BI. In Power BI, I generate detailed transaction reports. These reports analyze transaction trends, identifying the months with the highest transaction volumes, comparing transaction frequencies between male and female users, and determining the age groups most actively engaged in transactions.
